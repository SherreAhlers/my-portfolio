    "description": "This is the first coding project I worked on after graduating General Assembly. This is an Agile team project. Every week we participated in zoom meetings to share the work we accomplished for the week and get feedback. Each week we were give our tasks; I've always met my deadlines. This project was started as a React project building the website from the ground up. As we we nearing the end of the React build, it was decided that we would convert the project to use Gatsby instead of React. \nThis site was created to allow dancers in the San Fransisco area have a place to showcase their performances and themselves. This is similar to a social media platform but without all the negativity.",

I had never used Figma, so at first interpreting the desgin was a bit challenging, but through persistance and research I was able to bring the design to life.

I am applying all the information I have learned since creating the original project. \nI want this to be closer to a library of descriptions of books that people can interact with inorder to decide what to read next. I will also completely change the styling of the project to reflect what I have learned about CSS.",
